<!-- Plugin description -->

This plugin has the goal of being generally useful when working with nixpkgs/NixOS/nixops.
It currently adds support for the Nix language.
The following features are available:

 *  Syntax Highlighting
 *  Real time detection of syntax errors

We would also like to provide additional support for Nix/NixOS/NixOps,
but the following features are currently **not implemented**:

 *  Linting, code completion, formatting
 *  Profile management
 *  Run configurations
 *  Templates for common usage patterns
